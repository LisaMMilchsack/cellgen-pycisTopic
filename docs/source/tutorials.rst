In this section we present three different tutorials:

* **Using pycisTopic on human cerebellum single-cell multiome data**: This tutorial describes the complete pycisTopic workflow, using human cerebellum single-cell multiome data from 10x.

* **Using pycisTopic on simulated melanoma data**: This tutorial describes how to use pycisTopic when only the accessibility count matrix is available using a small dataset of 100 simulated cells from melanoma cell lines. This data set is ideal for trouble-shooting.

* **Using pycisTopic on the mouse cortex**: This tutorial describes how to use pycisTopic with multiple multiome samples, including batch correction. Here we only describe the minimal steps needed for SCENIC+, for additional analyses you can take a look to the previous tutorials.
